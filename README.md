# Pristine

Pristine is an open source repository in its original condition. It's goal is to be a starting point for open source repositories wanting to follow Documentation Driven Development. It is also a place for existing projects to find resources to augment current documentation.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive development but with open source specifically, starting at the README gives a middle ground between technical specifications and non-technical. This promotes open source contribution and engagement.

> By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on.

### Conventions and Specifications 

Using conventions and specifications make it easier to:
- build and use composable tools
- ease onboarding
- promote contribution and engagement
- promote issue and feature discussion on github itself

### Contributing

How to contribute, build and release are outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) and [RELEASING](RELEASING.md) respectively.

### Requirements

#### Docker:

Docker is used as a building block. Here are the resources needed to get started and install docker:

- [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
