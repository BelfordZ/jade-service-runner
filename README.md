# Pristine

Pristine is an open source repository in its original condition. Its goal is to be a starting point for open source repositories wanting to follow Documentation Driven Development. It is also a place for existing projects to find resources to augment current documentation.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development, starting at the README gives a middle ground between technical specifications and non-technical. This promotes open source contribution and engagement.

> By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, thereâ€™s something very bad going on.

### Conventions and Specifications 

Using conventions, documentation and specifications make it easier to:
- communicate the problem you are solving
- ease onboarding
- build and use composable tools
- promote open source contribution and engagement
- promote issue and feature discussion on Github itself
